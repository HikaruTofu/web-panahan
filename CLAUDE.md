# Project Rules & Context
**IMPORTANT:** This project uses a modular rule system. Before performing any task, you MUST read and follow the instructions in:
- `.agent/rules/identity.md` (Your persona and behavior)
- `.agent/rules/coding-style.md` (Design and coding standards)
- `.agent/workflow/protocols.md` (Execution protocols)

## Tooling Context
- Use the **Sequential Thinking** MCP for any complex reasoning.
- Use **shadcn** and **magic** (21st.dev) MCPs for UI components as defined in `.agent/rules/coding-style.md`.
